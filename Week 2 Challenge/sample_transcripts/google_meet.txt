10:00 AM Jennifer Lee: Hi team, welcome to our Product Roadmap Review meeting.
10:00 AM Alex Martinez: Hey everyone!
10:01 AM Rachel Kim: Good morning!
10:01 AM Jennifer Lee: Let's jump right in. We have a lot to cover today. First item is the Q1 feature releases.
10:02 AM Alex Martinez: I've been working on the analytics dashboard. It's about 80% complete, but I need to integrate the new charting library by December 15th.
10:02 AM Jennifer Lee: That's coming up soon. Can you make that deadline?
10:03 AM Alex Martinez: Yes, I'll prioritize it. I should have it done by then.
10:03 AM Rachel Kim: I can help with testing once it's ready. When do you think you'll need QA support?
10:04 AM Alex Martinez: Probably by December 12th. Rachel, could you schedule some time for testing that week?
10:04 AM Rachel Kim: Sure, I'll block out time on my calendar for testing the analytics dashboard.
10:05 AM Jennifer Lee: Excellent. Next topic - the mobile app redesign. Rachel, this is your project, right?
10:05 AM Rachel Kim: Yes. We need to finalize the design mockups by end of this week. I'm working with the design team on that.
10:06 AM Tom Wilson: Just joined, sorry I'm late!
10:06 AM Jennifer Lee: No worries, Tom. We're discussing the mobile app redesign.
10:07 AM Tom Wilson: Ah yes. I need to update the backend APIs to support the new mobile features. That's a critical task.
10:07 AM Jennifer Lee: When can you have that ready, Tom?
10:08 AM Tom Wilson: I'll need about two weeks. So I should complete the API updates by December 20th.
10:08 AM Rachel Kim: That works for me. I'll coordinate with you on the API specs.
10:09 AM Jennifer Lee: Great. Tom, please also document the API changes. That's important for the frontend team.
10:09 AM Tom Wilson: Will do. I'll create comprehensive API documentation as I go.
10:10 AM Alex Martinez: One thing - we still need to address the performance issues in the search functionality. Users are complaining it's too slow.
10:11 AM Jennifer Lee: That's urgent. Tom, can you investigate the search performance issues ASAP?
10:11 AM Tom Wilson: Absolutely. I'll look into it today and have a fix by tomorrow if possible.
10:12 AM Rachel Kim: I should also update our user onboarding flow. It's been on the backlog for a while. Nice to have but not critical.
10:13 AM Jennifer Lee: Good point. Rachel, work on the onboarding flow when you have time, maybe after the mobile redesign is done.
10:13 AM Alex Martinez: We also need to plan the next customer feedback session. Should we do that in January?
10:14 AM Jennifer Lee: Yes. Alex, please coordinate with the customer success team and schedule feedback sessions for early January.
10:14 AM Alex Martinez: Got it. I'll reach out to them this week.
10:15 AM Jennifer Lee: Perfect. Any other items we need to discuss?
10:15 AM Tom Wilson: I think we're good.
10:16 AM Rachel Kim: All set from my end.
10:16 AM Jennifer Lee: Excellent work, team. Let's execute on these action items and reconvene next week.
10:17 AM Alex Martinez: Sounds good. Thanks everyone!

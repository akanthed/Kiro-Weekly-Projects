Marketing Strategy Meeting - December 2025

Lisa Thompson: Welcome everyone to our marketing strategy session. We need to finalize our campaign plans for the new product launch.

Carlos Rivera: Thanks for organizing this, Lisa. I've been working on the social media strategy. We need to create content calendars for all platforms.

Lisa Thompson: Absolutely. Carlos, you should complete the social media content calendar by next Monday. That's our first priority.

Maria Santos: I can help with the content creation. What kind of posts are we looking at?

Carlos Rivera: We need a mix of product teasers, behind-the-scenes content, and customer testimonials. Maria, could you draft the initial post concepts by this Friday?

Maria Santos: Sure thing. I'll have at least 20 post concepts ready by Friday. I'll also include some video ideas.

Lisa Thompson: Excellent. Now, about the email campaign. James, are you on the call?

James Cooper: Yes, I'm here. Sorry, was on mute.

Lisa Thompson: No problem. We need to launch the email campaign by end of month. Can you handle the email templates and automation setup?

James Cooper: Definitely. I will set up the email templates and automation by December 28th. I'll also segment our audience for better targeting.

Carlos Rivera: Don't forget we need to update the landing page too. That's critical for conversions.

Lisa Thompson: Good catch. James, you must also update the landing page with the new product information. This is urgent since we're launching soon.

James Cooper: Got it. I'll prioritize the landing page and have it ready by next week.

Maria Santos: I should also coordinate with the design team for the visual assets. We need high-quality images and graphics.

Lisa Thompson: Yes, please do that ASAP. Maria, reach out to the design team today and get the assets by end of this week.

Maria Santos: Will do. I'll send them the brief this afternoon.

Carlos Rivera: What about the influencer partnerships? Are we moving forward with that?

Lisa Thompson: Yes, but that's lower priority. Carlos, when you have time, research potential influencer partners. No rush on this one.

Carlos Rivera: Okay, I'll work on that after the content calendar is done.

James Cooper: We should also set up analytics tracking for the campaign. I need to implement the tracking codes.

Lisa Thompson: Good point. James, please implement the analytics tracking by December 20th. We need to measure everything.

Maria Santos: I'll also need to prepare the press release. Should I coordinate with PR?

Lisa Thompson: Yes, definitely. Maria, you need to draft the press release and coordinate with PR by next Wednesday. This is important for our launch announcement.

Carlos Rivera: One more thing - should we plan a launch event?

Lisa Thompson: Let's discuss that in our next meeting. For now, let's focus on these immediate action items.

James Cooper: Sounds good. I'll get started on my tasks right away.

Maria Santos: Same here. Excited to see this campaign come together!

Carlos Rivera: Let's make this launch a success!

Lisa Thompson: Great energy, team. Let's execute and touch base next week with updates.
